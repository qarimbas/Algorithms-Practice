//Red-Black Tree (RBT) is a BST//we will always have h = O(lg n) for an RBT//Not every BST can be colored to form a RBT//RBT properties:/*1. Every node is red or black2. The root is black.3. Every leaf node is black(automatically guaranteed by using the	black RBT leaf nodes as the leaves).4. A red node always has two black children.5. Every path from the root to a leaf has the same number of black	nodes.*/
